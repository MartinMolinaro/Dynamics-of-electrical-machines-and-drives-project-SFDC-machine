Dynamics of electrical machines and drives project SFDC machine

[A.A. 2021/2022]
### On the use (USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND BE SMART):
This project has already been submitted and the prof has all the materials, hence do not copy or sent the same report contents (structure, computations, sentences, picture and drawings...) and matlab materials. 
The purpose of this public files is to use them as a reference for result comparison and for the simulink block build (for the simulink block in the report you MUST change at least the aesthetics, otherwise since it's public, it will be easy to spot that is a copy of another work).

P.S. on the evaluation: The project results are correct.
